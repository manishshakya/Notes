# Library vector Type

A vector is a collection of objects, all of which have the same type.

```C++
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
vector<int> ivec; // ivec holds objects of type int
vector<Sales_item> Sales_vec; // holds Sales_items
vector<vector<string>> file; // vector whose elements are vectors

vector<int> ivec; // initially empty // give ivec some values
vector<int> ivec2(ivec); // copy elements of ivec into ivec2
vector<int> ivec3 = ivec; // copy elements of ivec into ivec3
vector<string> svec(ivec2); // error: svec holds strings, not ints

vector<string> articles = {"a", "an", "the"};
vector<string> v1{"a", "an", "the"}; // list initialization
vector<string> v2("a", "an", "the"); // error

vector<int> ivec(10); // ten elements, each initialized to 0
vector<string> svec(10); // ten elements, each an empty string
```

## Ways to initialize a vector

`vector<T> v1` - vector that holds objects of type T. Default initialization; v1 is empty.
`vector<T> v2(v1)` - v2 has a copy of each element in v1.
`vector<T> v2 = v1` - Equivalent to v2(v1), v2 is a copy of the elements in v1.
`vector<T> v3(n, val)` - v3 has n elements with value val.
`vector<T> v4(n)` - v4 has n copies of a value-initialized object.
`vector<T> v5{a,b,c . . . }` - v5 has as many elements as there are initializers; elements are initialized by corresponding initializers.
`vector<T> v5 = {a,b,c . . . }` - Equivalent to v5{a,b,c . . . }

## vector Operations

`v.empty()` - Returns true if v is empty; otherwise returns false.
`v.size()` - Returns the number of elements in v.
`v.push_back(t)` - Adds an element with value t to end of v.
`v[n]` - Returns a reference to the element at position n in v.
`v1 = v2` - Replaces the elements in v1 with a copy of the elements in v2.
`v1 = {a,b,c . . . }` - Replaces the elements in v1 with a copy of the elements in the comma-separated list.
`v1 == v2` - v1 and v2 are equal if they have the same number of elements and each element in v1 is equal to the corresponding element in v2.
`v1 != v2`
`<, <=, >, >=` Have their normal meanings using dictionary ordering

## Subscripting

```C++
vector<int> ivec; // empty vector
cout << ivec[0]; // error: ivec has no elements!
vector<int> ivec2(10); // vector with ten elements
cout << ivec2[10]; // error: ivec2 has elements 0 . . . 9
```

It is an error to subscript an element that doesnâ€™t exist, but it is an error that the com-
piler is unlikely to detect. Instead, the value we get at run time is undefined.
