## Variable

- Initialization is not assignment.
- Initialization happens when a variable is given a value when it is created.
- Assignment obliterates an object’s current value and replaces that value with a new one.

### Variable Initialization

```C++
int units_sold = 0;
int units_sold = {0};
int units_sold{0};
int units_sold(0)
```

### Default Initialization

When we define a variable without an initializer, the variable is default initialized.
Such variables are given the “default” value.

### Compound Types

A compound type is a type that is defined in terms of another type.

#### References

A reference defines an alternative name for an object.

```C++
int ival = 1024;
int &refVal = ival;
```

Ordinarily, when we initialize a variable, the value of the initializer is copied into the object we are creating. When we define a reference, instead of copying the initializer’s value, we bind the reference to its initializer. Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to refer to a different object. Because there is no way to rebind a reference, references must be initialized.

**A reference is not an object. Instead, a reference is just another name for an already existing object.**

#### Pointers

A pointer is a compound type that “points to” another type. Like references, pointers are used for indirect access to other objects.
A pointer is an object.

```C++
int ival = 42;
int *p = &ival; // p holds the address of ival; p is a pointer to ival
```

#### Null Pointers

A null pointer does not point to any object. Code can check whether a pointer is null before attempting to use it.

```C++
int *p1 = nullptr; // equivalent to
int *p1 = 0;
int *p2 = 0; // directly initializes p2 from the literal constant 0
// must #include cstdlib
int *p3 = NULL; // equivalent to int *p3 = 0;
```

#### Assignment and Pointers

Both pointers and references give indirect access to other objects. However, there are important differences in how they do so.

The most important is that a references not an object.
Once we have defined a reference, there is no way to make that reference refer to a different object.
When we use a reference, we always get the object to which the reference was initially bound.

There is no such identity between a pointer and the address that it holds.
As with any other (nonreference) variable, when we assign to a pointer, we give the pointer itself a new value.
Assignment makes the pointer point to a different object.

#### void\* Pointers

The type void\* is a special pointer type that can hold the address of any object.

Like any other pointer, a void\* pointer holds an address, but the type of the object at that address is unknown.

#### References to Pointers

A reference is not an object. Hence, we may not have a pointer to a reference.

However, because a pointer is an object, we can define a reference to a pointer:

```C++
int i = 42;
int *p; // p is a pointer to int
int *&r = p; // r is a reference to the pointer p
r = &i; // r refers to a pointer; assigning &i to r makes p point to i
*r = 0; // dereferencing r yields i, the object to which p points; changes i to 0
```

The easiest way to understand the type of r is to read the definition right to left.
The symbol closest to the name of the variable (in this case the & in &r) is the one
that has the most immediate effect on the variable’s type. Thus, we know that r is
a reference. The rest of the declarator determines the type to which r refers. The
next symbol, \* in this case, says that the type r refers to is a pointer type. Finally,
the base type of the declaration says that r is a reference to a pointer to an int.

#### const Qualifier

We can make a variable unchangeable by defining the variable’s type as const:

```C++
const int bufSize = 512; // input buffer size defines bufSize as a constant.
```

Any attempt to assign to bufSize is an error:

```C++
bufSize = 512; // error: attempt to write to const object
```

#### References to const (const reference)

As with any other object, we can bind a reference to an object of a const type. To do so we use a reference to const, which is a reference that refers to a const type. Unlike an ordinary reference, a reference to const cannot be used to change the object to which the reference is bound:

```C++
const int ci = 1024;
const int &r1 = ci; // ok: both reference and underlying object are const
r1 = 42; // error: r1 is a reference to const
int &r2 = ci; // error: non const reference to a const object
```

#### A Reference to const May Refer to an Object That Is Not const

It is important to realize that a reference to const restricts only what we can do through that reference. Binding a reference to const to an object says nothing about whether the underlying object itself is const. Because the underlying object might be nonconst, it might be changed by other means:

```C++
int i = 42;
int &r1 = i; // r1 bound to i
const int &r2 = i; // r2 also bound to i; but cannot be used to change i
r1 = 0; // r1 is not const; i is now 0
r2 = 0; // error: r2 is a reference to const
```

#### const Pointers

Unlike references, pointers are objects. Hence, as with any other object type, we can have a pointer that is itself const. Like any other const object, a const pointer must be initialized, and once initialized, its value (i.e., the address that it holds) may not be changed. We indicate that the pointer is const by putting the const after the *. This placement indicates that it is the pointer, not the pointed-to type, that is const:
int errNumb = 0;
int *const curErr = &errNumb; // curErr will always point to errNumb
const double pi = 3.14159;
const double \*const pip = &pi; // pip is a const pointer to a const object

The easiest way to understand these declarations is to read them from right to left. In this case, the symbol closest to curErr is const, which means that curErr itself will be a const object. The type of that object is formed from the rest of the declarator.

#### constexpr and Constant Expressions

A constant expression is an expression whose value cannot change and that can be evaluated at compile time.

- A literal is a constant expression.
- A const object that is initialized from a constant expression is also a constant expression.
  As we’ll see, there are several contexts in the language that require constant expressions. Whether a given object (or expression) is a constant expression depends on the types and the initializers. For example:

```C++
const int max_files = 20; // max_files is a constant expression
const int limit = max_files + 1; // limit is a constant expression
int staff_size = 27; // staff_size is not a constant expression
const int sz = get_size(); // sz is not a constant expressio
```

#### constexpr variables

Under the new standard, we can ask the compiler to verify that a variable is a constant expression by declaring the variable in a constexpr declaration. Variables declared as constexpr are implicitly const and must be initialized by con- stant expressions:

```C++
constexpr int mf = 20; // 20 is a constant expression
constexpr int limit = mf + 1; // mf + 1 is a constant expression
constexpr int sz = size(); // ok only if size is a constexpr function
```

#### Pointers and constexpr

It is important to understand that when we define a pointer in a constexpr declaration, the constexpr specifier applies to the pointer, not the type to which the
pointer points:

```C++
const int *p = nullptr; // p is a pointer to a
const int constexpr int *q = nullptr; // q is a const pointer to int
```

Like any other constant pointer, a constexpr pointer may point to a const or a nonconst type:

```C++
constexpr int *np = nullptr; // np is a constant pointer to int that is null
int j = 0;
constexpr int i = 42; // type of i is const int
// i and j must be defined outside any function
constexpr const int *p = &i; // p is a constant pointer to the const int i
constexpr int *p1 = &j; // p1 is a constant pointer to the int j
```

## Dealing with types

### Type Aliases

A type alias is a name that is a synonym for another type.

```C++
typedef double wages;
```

The new standard introduced a second way to define a type alias, via an alias declaration:

```C++
using SI = Sales_item; // SI is a synonym for Sales_item
```

### The auto Type Specifier

By implication, a variable that uses auto as its type specifier must have an initializer:

```C++
// the type of item is deduced from the type of the result of adding val1 and val2
auto item = val1 + val2; // item initialized to the result of val1 + va

int i = 0, &r = i;
auto a = r; // a is an int ( r is an alias for i, which has type int)
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci; // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr; // c is an int ( cr is an alias for ci whose const is top-level)
auto d = &i; // d is an int* ( & of an int object is int*)
auto e = &ci; // e is const int\* ( & of a const object is low-level const)
const auto f = ci; // deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int
auto &g = ci; // g is a const int& that is bound to ci
auto &h = 42; // error: we can’t bind a plain reference to a literal
const auto &j = 42; // ok: we can bind a const reference to a literal
auto k = ci, &l = i; // k is int; l is int&
auto &m = ci, *p = &ci; // m is a const int&; p is a pointer to const int
// error: type deduced from i is int; type deduced from &ci is
const int auto &n = i, *p2 = &ci;
```

### The decltype Type Specifier

Sometimes we want to define a variable with a type that the compiler deduces
from an expression but do not want to use that expression to initialize the variable.

For such cases, the new standard introduced a second type specifier, decltype,
which returns the type of its operand.

```C++
decltype(f()) sum = x; // sum has whatever type f returns
```

Here, the compiler does not call f, but it uses the type that such a call would return
as the type for sum. That is, the compiler gives sum the same type as the type that
would be returned if we were to call f.

When the expression to which we apply decltype is a variable, decltype returns the type of that variable, including top-level const and
references:

```C++
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;
decltype(ci) x = 0; // x has type const int
decltype(cj) y = x; // y has type const int& and is bound to x
decltype(cj) z; // error: z is a reference and must be initialize
```

### decltype and references

```C++
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
decltype(r + 0) b; // ok: addition yields an int; b is an (uninitialized) int
decltype(*p) c; // error: c is int& and must be initialized
```

```C++
// decltype of a parenthesized variable is always a reference
decltype((i)) d; // error: d is int& and must be initialized
decltype(i) e; // ok: e is an (uninitialized) int
```

Remember that decltype((variable)) (note, double parentheses) is always a reference type, but decltype(variable) is a reference type only if variable is a reference.
